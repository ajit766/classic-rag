# Product Requirements Document (PRD): "The Modern Sage"

## 1. Product Overview
**"The Modern Sage"** is a conversational AI assistant that provides holistic self-help advice by synthesizing wisdom from two distinct domains:
1.  **Modern Behavioral Science** (e.g., *Atomic Habits*, *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, *7 Habits*)
2.  **Timeless Spiritual Wisdom** (e.g., *The Bhagavad Gita*)

The goal is to offer users a balanced perspective—practical, actionable steps backed by science, grounded in deep spiritual or philosophical meaning.

## 2. Core Value Proposition
-   **Holistic Guidance**: Answers aren't just one-dimensional productivity tips; they include the "why" and "meaning" behind the actions.
-   **Trust & Verifiability**: Every claim is backed by direct citations from the source texts.
-   **Dual-Lens Synthesis**: Uniquely blends two often-separated worlds into a coherent narrative.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1. The "Sage" Chat Interface
-   **Conversational Logic**: Users can ask natural language questions (e.g., "How do I stop procrastinating?" or "I feel lost in my career").
-   **Context Awareness**: The AI remembers previous turns to allow for follow-up questions.
-   **Source Citations**: *Critical Requirement*. Every major point in the answer must link back to specific book passages (Book Title, Chapter/Verse).

### 3.2. Knowledge Base (The "Library")
-   **Content Types**: PDF/Text ingestion of key selected books.
-   **Domains**: 
    -   *Science/Strategy*: Atomic Habits, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Thinking Fast and Slow.
    -   *Spirituality/Philosophy*: The Bhagavad Gita.

### 3.3. Response Structure (The "Fusion" Format)
The AI response should ideally follow a structured approach:
1.  **The Scientific View**: Practical mechanisms, psychology, and tactical steps.
2.  **The Spiritual View**: Higher-level principle, duty (Dharma), or mindset.
3.  **Synthesis**: How to combine both for the user's situation.

## 4. Success Metrics
-   **Citation Accuracy**: Are the quotes actually from the books?
-   **Synthesis Quality**: Does the answer feel cohesive?
-   **User Value**: Does the advice feel "deep" rather than generic?
